# ⚡ Elite Developer Portfolio (Cybersecurity + AI)

> **"A portfolio that behaves like a decision engine, not just a gallery."**

This is not a standard template. It is a high-performance, conversion-optimized personal platform built for **Satyam Raghuvanshi**, sitting at the intersection of **Cybersecurity, Machine Learning, and Creative Development**.

## 🚀 The Philosophy: "Respect the Recruiter's Time"

Most portfolios are passive museums. This one is an **Active Decision Engine**.
It assumes the user (recruiter/founder) is busy, and provides two distinct paths:

1. **The Fast Track (Recruiter Mode)**: A 60-second, high-density modal that strips away the storytelling and delivers raw value metrics, tech stacks, and resume downloads instantly.
2. **The Deep Dive (Exploration)**: An immersive, Netflix-style journey through Projects, Certifications, and "Creative Mode" for those who want the full story.
